This package is the unmaintained branch of serde-yaml.

It started as the initiative to take over and further maintain the highly popular
[serde_yaml](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml) library after it has been set as read only on GitHub and also
marked as deprecated. We no longer have these plans. Some very minimal work has been done after forking,
like version number of some packages have been advanced a little bit, some more tests have been added from
the [abandoned pull request](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/pull/376) by Fishrock123 as in GitHub and
the sanitized text of the unresolved anchor is now included in the error message. That's it.

This package will not be longer maintained and we do not recommend using it. We have switched into
[yaml-rust2](https://github.com/Ethiraric/yaml-rust2) that has the active developer community and recommend
you to do something similar.
