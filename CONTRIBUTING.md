# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, whether they are bug fixes, improvements, documentation updates, or new features (if aligned with the project scope).

## How to Contribute

0. **Open a feature request first**
    - Before implementing a new feature, open an issue to discuss it.
    - Provide use cases, and link to relevant specification documents where possible.
    - Submitting a surprise pull request without prior discussion often leads to wasted effort and frustration on all sides.

1. **Fork and branch**
    - Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.

2. **Code style**
    - Follow standard Rust coding style and conventions.
    - Use `rustfmt` and `clippy` to keep the code consistent and clean.
    - It should be no warnings in new code.
    - Keep changes minimal, focused, and easy to review.

3. **Tests**
    - Add or update tests for any new code.
    - Ensure that all tests pass locally before submitting a pull request.

4. **Commits**
    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
    - Keep commits logically organized (squash when appropriate).

5. **Pull requests**
    - Submit your pull request against `main`.
    - Include a concise description of the change and its motivation.
    - Be open to feedback and willing to revise your code as needed.


## AI Usage

AI-generated contributions are **permitted**, but they will be reviewed by the same acceptance criteria as any other code.  
Submissions may be rejected if they include:

- unnecessary rewrites,
- overcomplicated solutions,
- features not in the YAML 1.1 or 1.2 specifications,
- unreasonably high numbers of pull requests from the same author,
- missing or insufficient test coverage.

In short: AI can help, but **you are responsible for the quality of your contribution**.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the issue tracker to report bugs or request features.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce bugs where possible (ideally the test case)
