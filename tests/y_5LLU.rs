// 5LLU: Block scalar with wrong indented line after spaces only — marked fail: true
// Expect parsing to return an error (no panic).

// A line with only spaces counts as a blank line, but those spaces are removed (blank lines are treated as empty).
// The first non-blank line determines the content indentation. Here, the first such line is " invalid" (4 spaces).
// But before that, you had lines with 2 and 3 spaces only, which don’t match the inferred 4-space indent.
// According to the YAML 1.2 spec, that’s an indentation violation → parsing error
