/// This test verifies YAML line folding inside double-quoted scalars.
///
/// According to the YAML 1.2 spec (ยง7.3.3.2):
/// - Line breaks in double-quoted scalars (not escaped with `\`) are converted to a single space.
/// - Leading and trailing spaces inside the quotes are preserved.
///
/// Example:
/// ```yaml
/// " foo
/// bar
/// baz "
/// ```
///
/// is parsed as the string:
/// ```text
///  foo bar baz
/// ```
///
/// This test ensures that `serde_yaml_bw` follows the spec by folding the
/// embedded newlines into spaces while retaining the outer whitespace.
